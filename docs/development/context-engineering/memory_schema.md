# Memory schema (session vs long-term)

> **Purpose:** Define what we treat as "session notes" vs "long-term memory" so we don’t over-build infra. No DB required for v0.1.

---

## 1. Layers (conventions only)

| Layer | What it is | Where it lives | Retention |
|-------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| **Working** | Current task, last file opened, current plan | Agent context / scratch (e.g. current conversation) | Until session ends |
| **Session notes** | Today’s decisions, "what we did this session," open questions | Optional: `docs/development/scratch/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or in chat | Session or a few days |
| **Long-term** | Release decisions, "why we chose X," patterns, release state | `CHANGELOG.md`, `docs/development/MEMORY.md` or `release_notes/`, TEST_REPORT | Indefinite (repo history) |

---

## 2. What to write where

| Content | Prefer |
|---------|--------|
| "We decided Modulio 4 skaidrė order is 4.1–4.7 only" | CONTENT_MODULIU_ATPAZINIMAS.md or MEMORY.md / changelog |
| "Current task: review MODULIO_4_TURINIO_PERZIURA" | Session (scratch or chat); no need to persist |
| "Release 2026-02-12: M4 lietuviškos, HomePage CTA" | CHANGELOG.md; optional MEMORY.md bullet |
| Bugs / test failures | docs/development/TEST_REPORT.md |
| User feedback and next actions | docs/VARTOTOJU_ATSILIEPIMAI_BENDRAS.md |

---

## 3. What we do **not** store as "memory" (v0.1)

- User progress (stays in localStorage only; no server).
- Vector embeddings or semantic search (out of scope).
- Cross-session agent state (we have no persistent agent; each session is fresh).

---

## 4. Optional: one MEMORY.md

If the team wants a single "why we did X" file:

- **Path:** `docs/development/MEMORY.md`
- **Format:** Short bullets; date prefix optional. Example:
  - `2026-02-12: Modulio 4 skaidrės 4.1–4.7 only; Modulio 6 sections have no 4.x numbers (see CONTENT_MODULIU_ATPAZINIMAS).`
- **When to update:** After a non-obvious decision that future contributors (or agents) should know.
